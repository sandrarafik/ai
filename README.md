# **Purpose and Business Benefits**

## **The goal of suggested orders is**

1. Boost sales and MSL coverage
2. Optimize product assortment suggestions for weekly orders
3. Estimate order volumes at the outlet level
4. Improve clarity and understanding of:
  - Outlet-specific gaps
  - MSL for each outlet




## **Four main components of suggested orders:**

1. **MSL:**

- Designed to increase MSL coverage
- the benefit is to increase MSL distribution and availability, ensuring alignment with the companyâ€™s goals and targets
- Initially, all MSL suggestions were pushed without a set percentage to keep but this overwhelmed the business developers
- The focus is now on determining the optimal number of MSL suggestions per customer based on compliance
- To improve efficiency and focus

2. **Historicity**:

- Recommend product assortments based on customers' historical data
- Maintain regular stock levels of commonly purchased SKUs
- **The benefit** is to increase customer satisfaction
  - Tailored recommendations make customers feel valued
  - This boosts loyalty
- Increases outlet value by:
  - Suggesting product assortments aligned with customer preferences and purchase history
  - Leading to higher chances of repeat purchases
  - Improving sales at the outlet level
- **Frequently Sold suggestions rely on a percentage to keep**, based on order size seasonality
- Typically, this percentage is **100% during the first two weeks of the Hellenic month**
  - Business developers tend to bulk order during this time
- As the month progresses:
  - The percentage decreases
  - Focus shifts more to collection visits and less on orders



3. **Promos:**

- Where suggested orders can be used to drive promotional suggestions
- The benefit here is that promos are effectively communicated at the outlet level
- Ensuring they reach the right customers
- generate increased sales


4. **New Launches:**

- Which increases the distribution of new products
- And ensures execution excellence
- Driving successful product introductions at the outlet level
